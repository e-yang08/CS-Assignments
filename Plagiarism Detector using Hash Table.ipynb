    "<b>Justification about implementation:</b> Hashing is an efficient data structure to store and search substrings and to detect plagiarism. It can save time in probing the matches by using hash functions and employing rolling hashing and double hashing. Although hashing is not suitable for finding a value given a particular input range, plagiarism detection involves more of a particular value match, so it does not concern our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our primary goal in building hashing is to avoid hash collisions, I carefully think about the choice of base for converting the string into an integer. Here, I use the prime number to fulfill that aim. Here, I use 131 as a base because it is a prime larger than the largest ASCII code, 127 (source: http://cactus.io/tutorials/web/what-is-an-ascii-code), so that the base would not equal to any ASCII codes and the overlapping integer key can be avoided to the best extent, while the computation would not take a long time compared to the larger base value. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning the efficiency of the collision resolution strategy since there is always a possibility of a hash collision happening. I employ double hashing, one of the open-addressing methods since it limits every slot to store only one node and takes less time to probe the node of interest by using the hash functions instead of partially using the inefficient list probing alongside the hash function in the chaining method. In implementing double hashing, I make sure that the second hash function can help search all slots in the hash table in combination with the first one. Thus, I modify the first hash function to make the second one so that they can complement each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I carefully think about the case where the exact same substrings are detected in one input string. Although I initially plan to store them as different nodes in distinct slots in the hash table, I realize that way can involve more probing computation (both when inserting node and finding node) if there are many repetitions in the input string. For better time efficiency, I decide to store all duplicates into one node by modifying the node’s attributes and making it store the list of an index of a substring with the exact same letters, and the letters of the substring as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, for the hash table size, I choose a prime that is approximately 1.3 times larger than the string’s length minus the length of substrings for matching (source: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kube/cls/100/Lectures/lec16/lec16-8.html). This rule of thumb is useful because it considers 1) the possibility of overflowing key-value pairs by having completely filled hashtable and 2) a large required space due to the overestimated hash table size. Besides, we can transfer the hash table size as the hash function’s divisor (*q* in ‘a mod q’). Since the remainder is always smaller than the divisor, it is a perfect fit for the index in the hash table as we don’t have to re-run the hush function to find the index smaller than the hash table size. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, a hash function is expected to produce various hashed values to prevent a collision. Since collision requires another hashing and takes more time, the overall hashing operation can go against the initial aim of hashing, efficient storing and matching, due to the inefficient hash function. This characteristic also relates to the ability to probe all the indexes in the hashtable. A hash function needs to produce all indexes ranging from 0 to len(hashtable)-1 so that it can make sure the value can be stored in an empty spot or the value of interest can be found. This feature is especially of importance when employing double hashing since the second function is meant to complement the first one and the combination of them is significantly crucial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the optimal hash function generates an equivalent index if it receives the same key inputs. This feature is important to find duplicates from the same string input or match from another string input because if the hash function yields a random value, it would take time to find the already-stored value that has the same key.\n",

It is because the probe function can find the ith slot occupied with a probability around $α^i (= n/m = load factor)$. From a geometric progression, the sum of those probabilities is $1/(1-α)$. Given that $α < 1$, $1/(1-α) < 1$, and therefore, it is guaranteed to have O(1) runtime. \n",

    "\n",
    "Although both of them share the same asymptotic time complexity notation, it requires various time duration to detect plagiarism for different cases. The differences between Q1 and Q2 are 1) hash function and 2) the way strings are converted into integer keys. Since both versions of hash functions involve almost the same math computation which requires asymptotically equivalent time, we will focus on difference 2) mainly.\n",

Here, the non-rolling-hashing version (Q2) is faster than the rolling hashing version (Q1) ($(Q1, Q2) ≒ (0.0042,  0.0015)$). The Q2 version is more efficient probably because the hash function in that version effectively probes the non-matching strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second version is when two strings have many common substrings and are the case of plagiarism. Here, the rolling hashing version (Q1) is a lot faster than the non-rolling-hashing version (Q2) ($(Q1, Q2) ≒ (0.003,  0.02)$). The Q1 version is much more efficient potentially because the hash function in that version effectively probes the empty spot and store the key-value pairs with less collision. Also, the process of rolling hashing takes less time than computing every single common substring from scratch. Therefore, those two factors contribute to the saved runtime of the Q1 version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last version is when two strings have exactly the same strings and the strings are made of repeated substrings with the length of k. Here, the rolling hashing version (Q1) and the non-rolling-hashing version (Q2) are equivalently fast ($(Q1, Q2) ≒ (0.002,  0.002)$). It means that when the algorithm computes the integer key, there is no difference between the Q1 and Q2 versions. It may be because the strings consist of repeating substrings and that removing and adding a letter to three-letter strings is almost the same computation as calculating the integer key from three letters. \n",
