    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-completion functionalities are now ubiquitous in search engines, document editors, and messaging apps. How would you go about developing an algorithmic strategy from scratch to implement these computational solutions? In this assignment, you will learn about a new data structure and use it to build a very simple auto-complete engine. Each question in the assignment guides you closer to that objective while encouraging you to contrast this novel data structure to the other ones we have discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [trie tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), or a prefix tree, is a common data structure that stores a set of strings in a collection of nodes so that all strings with a common prefix are found in the same branch of the tree. Each node is associated with a letter, and as you traverse down the tree, you pick up more letters, eventually forming a word. Complete words are commonly found on the leaf nodes. However, some inner nodes can also mark full words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use an example diagram to illustrate several important features of tries:\n",
    "\n",
    "![tries01.png](attachment:tries01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nodes that mark valid words are marked in yellow. Notice that while all leaves are considered valid words, only some inner nodes contain valid words, while some remain only prefixes to valid words appearing down the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tree does not have to be balanced, and the height of different branches depends on its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our implementation, branches never merge to show common suffixes (for example, both ANT and ART end in T, but these nodes are kept separate in their respective branches). However, this is a common first line of memory optimization for tries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first node contains an empty string; it “holds the tree together.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this assignment will be to implement a functional trie tree. You will be able to insert words into a dictionary, lookup valid and invalid words, print your dictionary in alphabetical order, and suggest appropriate suffixes like an auto-complete bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment questions will guide you through these tasks one by one. To stay safe from breaking your own code, and to reinforce the idea of code versioning, under each new question first **copy your previous (working) code**, and only then **implement the new feature**. The code skeletons provided throughout will make this easier for you at the cost of repeating some large portions of code."

    "## Q1: Implement a trie tree\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will write Python code that can take a set/list/tuple of strings and insert them into a trie tree and lookup whether a specific word/string is present in the trie tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1a: Theoretical pondering\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches to building trees, you might recall from class, are making separate Tree and Node classes, or only making a Node class. Which method do you think is a better fit for trie trees, and why? **Justify your reasoning in around 100 words.** You will use your chosen approach throughout the assignment, so don't rush this question."

    "Besides, using only the Node class is more inefficient in performing operations on the trie because ‘self’ in this class would be each node and we have to repeatedly call the method on different nodes to update the trie entirely or partially. As ‘self’ cannot be updated to another node in the class, to reach those near leaf nodes, we have to store a large amount of data about the node at the higher height.\n",

    "In the two cells below, there are two code skeletons. Depending on your answer to Q1a, either **implement a Node and a Trie class** or **implement a Node class**. Choose the corresponding code cell and delete the other one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your class(es), write **insert()** and **lookup()** methods, which will insert a word into the trie tree and look it up, respectively. Use the code skeleton and examine the specifications of its docstrings to guide you on the details of inputs and outputs to each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are coding two classes, your Trie should, upon initiation, create the root Node. If you are coding a single class, use an attribute to mark the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, make sure that the trie can be **initiated with a wordbank as an input**. This means that a user can create a trie and feed it an initial dictionary of words at the same time (like in the tests below), which will be automatically inserted into the trie upon its creation. Likely, this will mean that your \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has to make some calls to your insert() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several test cases have been provided for your convenience and these include some, but not all, possible edge cases. If the implementation is correct, your code will pass all the tests. In addition, create at least **three more tests** to demonstrate that your code is working correctly and justify why such test cases are appropriate."

    "Suppose that L represents the number of letters in the word you want to insert or lookup. For the insert(), the time complexity is O(L). In insertion, we first lowercase the input word by using the .lower() method that takes O(L). We then go into the for loop of creating the nodes each of which consists of a letter of the input word. This for loop part takes O(L) because it performs an operation taking O(1) in one loop and runs L times (O(L×1) = O(L)). Therefore, O(L) + O(L) = 2O(L), which is asymptotically O(L).\n",

    "The lookup() is similarly structured as the insert(), and its time complexity is O(L). After using the .lower() method that takes O(L), the algorithm enters the for loop to search if a letter from the input word exists in the current node of search. This for loop operation takes O(L) because it performs an operation taking O(1) in one loop and runs L times (O(L×1) = O(L)). Therefore, O(L) + O(L) = 2O(L), which is asymptotically O(L). One rare case to be noted is that if the .lookup() method L = 0, it’ll be O(1) because the first two lines of the .lookup() method ask to return True if it received input without any word or letter.\n",
    "If N represents the number of words inserted into the tree and l represents the average length of those words, the time complexity for the insert() operation for all words in the list would be O(N×l). Similarly, the lookup() operation for all the words in another list would also take O(N×l). \n",

    "Both BSTs’ insert and lookup methods have a time complexity, O(h), because, upon insertion or search, we only compare once per depth. If it is balanced, h would be log N. However, since BST restricts each node’s number of children to two, while there are 26 characters for the alphabets and many varieties of combinations of characters upon making words, it is very likely to have an unbalanced BSTs and nearly worst-case time complexity where O(N) for both insert() and lookup(). Furthermore, in BSTs, the larger alphabets are likely to store on a deeper level, which makes it inefficient to find the words starting with the larger alphabets, whereas the trie allows us to almost equally efficiently find the words starting from any alphabets as long as they are in the similar number of letters.  \n",

On the other hand, the BSTs can have a height of 2, which depends on the type of BST can be reduced to a height of 1. However, the trie can implement many methods other than insertion and lookup methods, such as the autofill dictionary because it stores a single letter per node and can store multiple words with an overlapping prefix into one single path.\n"

    "Test case #1 is a palindrome that allows us to check if the algorithm stores the strings in the correct alphabetical order. Since the first and the last words of the sentence contain the same letters but in different orders, this test case is an efficient way to check if the method correctly collects the words spread in the trie in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test case #2 checks if some special alphabetical characters, such as é, ê, and ù, can be alphabetically ordered and outputted in the list. Although those characters generally do not exist in the English sentences, I use French text as a test case to account for that. Since the max() method works for those characters too, this algorithm is proven to be workable for those cases as well.\n",
    " \n",
    "Test case #3 sees if the code accounts for the duplication at the beginning of the words. In my code, I add some conditions for a node’s value to be updated. For instance, if node ‘a’ has a child node ‘m,’ that child node ‘m’ would have ‘am’ as its value. Besides, this test case also verifies the correct alphabetical order for those words with multiple same letters at the word’s start (e.g., the order should be ‘a’, ‘aa’, ‘aaa’). Since the existence of duplicated letters is the edge case for those senses, I add this test case. Though most English words have distinct first and second letters, some Korean letters have aspirated sounds (i.e., strongly pronounced letters), such as ‘ttaeme’ or ‘jjigeo’ which results in the same first and second letters in one word. Thus, I use the romanized Korean letters as an example. "

    "\n",
    "To mathematically determine the overall connotation of a speech, you might want to compute which words are most frequently used and then run a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis). To this end, add a method to your code, **k_most_common()** that will take as an input k, an integer, and return a list of the k most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you’re confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you don’t have to bother with resolving ties (for example, if k = 1, but there are two most common words with the same frequency, you can return either of them), but consider it an extra challenge and let us know if you believe you managed to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cell below downloads and preprocesses several real-world speeches, and then runs the k-most-common word analysis of them; your code should pass the tests. As usual, add at least **three more tests**, and justify why they are relevant to your code (feel free to find more speeches to start analysing too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, copy-paste your previous code and make adjustments to this \"new version\". The first cell has been locked to stop you from accidentally deleting the docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this question well will help you to tackle Q5!\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Hint: This task will probably require your nodes to store more information about the frequency of words inserted into the tree. One data structure that might be very useful to tackle the problem of traversing the tree and finding most common words is heaps — you are allowed to use the heapq library or another alternative for this task.)*"

    "I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what \n",

    "of despair, you believe there can be hope. In the face of a politics that's shut you \n",

    "know, I am not a native of this great state. I moved to Illinois over two decades \n",
    "ago. I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, \n",
    "was without money or family connections. But a group of churches had offered me a job\n",
    "as a community organizer for $13,000 a year. And I accepted the job, sight unseen, \n",
    "motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in\n",
    "building a better America. My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest \n",
    "neighborhoods. I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had\n",
    "been ravaged by plant closings. I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply \n",
    "local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant \n",
    "executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to \n",
    "the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child \n",
    "turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill. It was \n",
    "in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I \n",
    "learned the true meaning of my Christian faith. After three years of this work, I \n",
    "went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those \n",
    "in need. I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a \n",
    "time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend \n",
    "on the active participation of an awakened electorate. It was with these ideas in \n",
    "mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator. It was here, in \n",
    "Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, \n",
    "businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a \n",
    "seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard. I made lasting friendships here\n",
    "- friends that I see in the audience today. It was here we learned to disagree \n",
    "without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know \n",
    "those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to \n",
    "listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst. That's \n",
    "why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken. That's why we were\n",
    "able to give health insurance to children in need. That's why we made the tax system \n",
    "more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that\n",
    "the cynics said could never, ever be passed. It was here, in Springfield, where \n",
    "North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential \n",
    "decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, \n",
    "we can build a more hopeful America. And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State \n",
    "Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common\n",
    "hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for \n",
    "President of the United States. I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a \n",
    "certain audacity - to this announcement. I know I haven't spent a lot of time \n",
    "learning the ways of Washington. But I've been there long enough to know that the \n",
    "ways of Washington must change. The genius of our founders is that they designed a \n",
    "system of government that can be changed. And we should take heart, because we've \n",
    "changed this country before. In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an \n",
    "Empire to its knees. In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the \n",
    "captives free. In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted \n",
    "millions out of poverty. We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to\n",
    "the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll\n",
    "down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream. Each and every time, a new \n",
    "generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done. Today we are called once \n",
    "more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call. For that is our \n",
    "unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country\n",
    "can change it. That's what Abraham Lincoln understood. He had his doubts. He had his \n",
    "defeats. He had his setbacks. But through his will and his words, he moved a nation \n",
    "and helped free a people. It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that\n",
    "we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free. It is because men and \n",
    "women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long \n",
    "after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges \n",
    "of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans. All of us know what those \n",
    "challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our \n",
    "future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling \n",
    "paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can. We know the challenges. \n",
    "We've heard them. We've talked about them for years. What's stopped us from meeting \n",
    "these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans. What's \n",
    "stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease \n",
    "with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough \n",
    "decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up \n",
    "our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems. For the last six\n",
    "years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the \n",
    "anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an \n",
    "illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an \n",
    "ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight. And when all \n",
    "else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told \n",

    "system for capping greenhouse gases. We can turn this crisis of global warming into a\n",
    "moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for \n",

    "makes future generations proud of what we did here. Most of all, let's be the \n",
    "generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the \n",
    "terrorists with everything we've got. Politics doesn't have to divide us on this \n",

    "later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished \n",
    "from this Earth. This is your victory. I know you didn’t do this just to win an \n",

    "will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won’t \n",

    "we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask\n",

    "if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall\n",

    "one people. Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and \n",

    "liberty, and national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic \n",
    "Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and \n",
    "determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said \n",
    "to a nation far more divided than ours, “We are not enemies, but friends…though \n",
    "passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” And to those \n",
    "Americans whose support I have yet to earn – I may not have won your vote, but I hear\n",

    "watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who \n",
    "are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are \n",
    "singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at \n",
    "hand. To those who would tear this world down – we will defeat you. To those who seek\n",
    "peace and security – we support you. And to all those who have wondered if America’s \n",
    "beacon still burns as bright – tonight we proved once more that the true strength of \n",
    "our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but \n",
    "from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and \n",
    "unyielding hope. For that is the true genius of America – that America can change. \n",
    "Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what \n",

    "to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing – Ann Nixon Cooper is\n",
    "106 years old. She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no\n",
    "cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn’t vote for two \n",
    "reasons – because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. And tonight, \n",
    "I think about all that she’s seen throughout her century in America – the heartache \n",
    "and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can’t, \n",
    "and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. At a time when \n",
    "women’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand \n",
    "up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can. When there was despair in the \n",
    "dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a\n",
    "New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can. When the bombs fell\n",
    "on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation\n",
    "rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can. She was there for the buses \n",
    "in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from \n",
    "Atlanta who told a people that “We Shall Overcome.” Yes we can. A man touched down on\n",
    "the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and \n",
    "imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and\n",
    "cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the \n",
    "darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes we can. America, we have come\n",
    "so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask\n",
    "ourselves – if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters \n",
    "should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? \n",
    "What progress will we have made? This is our chance to answer that call. This is our \n",
    "moment. This is our time – to put our people back to work and open doors of \n",
    "opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to \n",
    "reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth – that out of many, we\n",
    "are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and \n",
    "doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed \n",

    "common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our \n",
    "Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to \n",

    "expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching \n",
    "today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know\n",
    "that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a \n",
    "future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more. Recall that earlier \n",
    "generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but \n",
    "with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power \n",
    "alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they \n",
    "knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the \n",
    "justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility \n",
    "and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once \n",
    "more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater \n",
    "cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave \n",
    "Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends \n",
    "and former foes, we’ll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back \n",
    "the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will \n",
    "we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing \n",
    "terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and \n",
    "cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. For we know that our\n",
    "patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and \n",
    "Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and \n",
    "culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter \n",
    "swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and \n",
    "more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that\n",
    "the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common \n",
    "humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a \n",
    "new era of peace. To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual \n",
    "interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow \n",
    "conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West - know that your people will \n",
    "judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power \n",
    "through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the \n",
    "wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench \n",
    "your fist. To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make \n",
    "your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed \n",
    "hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we \n",
    "can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we \n",
    "consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, \n",
    "and we must change with it. As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we \n",
    "remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol \n",
    "far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the \n",
    "fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only \n",
    "because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of \n",
    "service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet,\n",
    "at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit\n",
    "that must inhabit us all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is \n",
    "ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation \n",
    "relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the \n",
    "selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their\n",
    "job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm\n",
    "a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, \n",
    "that finally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which \n",
    "we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - honesty \n",
    "and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism\n",
    "- these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of \n",
    "progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. \n",
    "What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the \n",
    "part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, \n",
    "duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the \n",
    "knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our \n",
    "character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise\n",
    "of citizenship. This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls \n",
    "on us to shape an uncertain destiny. This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed\n",
    "- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in \n",
    "celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty \n",
    "years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you \n",
    "to take a most sacred oath. So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are \n",
    "and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of \n",
    "months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy \n",
    "river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with \n",
    "blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father \n",
    "of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: \"Let it be told to the \n",
    "future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could \n",
    "survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to \n",
    "meet [it].\" America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our \n",
    "hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave \n",
    "once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our \n",
    "children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that\n",
    "we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's \n",
    "grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to\n",
    "future generations. Thank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of \n",

    "Your task is to create a new **autocomplete()** method for your class, which will take a string as an input, and return another string as an output. If the string is not present in the tree, the output will be the same as the input. However, if the string is present in the tree, your task is to find the most common word to which it is a prefix and return that word instead (this can still turn out to be itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the task more interesting, use the test cell code to download and parse “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare”, and insert them into a trie. Your autocomplete should then pass the following tests. As usual, add at least **three more test cases**, and explain why they are appropriate (you can use input other than Shakespeare for them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include a minimum **100 word-summary critically evaluating** your autocomplete engine. How does it really work? Your critical reflection needs to specifically evaluate the role of the different data structures used by their algorithm and what is the overall complexity that the algorithm offers. Can we do better? If so, how and by how much?\n",

    "*This is a thoroughly frequentist approach to the problem, which is not the only method, and in many cases not the ideal method. However, if you were tasked with implementing something like [this](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) or [this](https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/autocomplete/), it might just be enough, so let’s give it a go. Good luck!*"

    "First, I check if any word in the tree includes the prefix. As soon as the code detects the mismatch between the prefix and available word (letters), it returns the prefix. If the prefix itself is a word in the trie and there is no other word that includes the prefix, we don’t call k_most_common() and just return the prefix. Otherwise, we call prepare() method to update the letter (each node’s value) and find the most common phrase that comes after the last letter of prefix by calling sub_k_most_common() method. Lastly, we combine part of the prefix and the most common phrase and output this as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this operation is asimptotically O(N×l). If the prefix’s length is P, the number of words inserted into the trie is N, and the average length of those words is l, the time complexity will be O(P) <for loop of checking all prefix>+ O(1) <if condition for returning prefix> + O(N×l) <calling prepare() method> + O(N×(l-p)) <calling sub_k_most_common() method> + O(l^2) <string concatenation>, which is asimptotically O(N×l).\n",

    "Since there is some duplicate operation of prepare() method, we may do better by removing the overlapping part. For instance, after calling prepare() method for all the nodes in the trie, we call prepare() partially for the sub_k_most_common(), which means there is an unnecessary overlapping. I might able to avoid this problem by having separate methods. First method updates all the nodes’ values (i.e., self.letter) without creating an alphabetically ordered list. Second method specifically focuses on finding the most common phrase that comes after the last letter of prefix but does not have to check the if statement that checks if the nodes’ values are updated or not. The runtime can be shorter by little, but asimptotically there is no difference between the current and improved version because calling prepare() method is still remaining.\n",
